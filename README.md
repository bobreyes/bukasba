# Project Description
It was 08 March 2020 when President Rodrigo Roa Duterte signed Proclamation 922 placing the entire Philippines under a State of Public Health Emergency due to the COVID-19 threat. On 12 March 2020, President Duterte announced that the entire National Capital Region (NCR -- Metro Manila) will be placed under a Community Quarantine effective 0001H of 15 March 2020 until 0001 of 14 April 2020 (initially). All malls and business establishments, except for food outlets, groceries, supermarkets, and pharmacies, were ordered to be closed during the Community Quarantine period.

One of the problems which arise due to Community Quarantine (or lockdown) is the lack of information available to which neighborhood stores and shops are open.

BukasBa.xyz is a crowdsourced map of Metro Manila and nearby provinces made during the Luzon Enhanced Community Quarantine of 2020. to check if a store or facility is open. "Bukas ba?" or "Is it open?"
